`docling-translate` is a fast and intuitive open-source translation tool that helps non-native English-speaking students, engineers, and researchers read and understand technical PDF documents with ease.

---

## 🤔 Why use `docling-translate`?

Have you ever faced these challenges when translating technical documents?

*   📄 Copying content from a PDF breaks the formatting, making it difficult to even paste into a translator.
*   😵 Existing translators provide awkward, context-free results that are hard to trust.
*   📑 You waste time switching between the original and translated texts, constantly losing your flow.

`docling-translate` solves all these problems by combining the powerful document analysis capabilities of the **`docling` library** with a **sentence-by-sentence parallel view**.

## ✨ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **📖 Side-by-Side Sentence Comparison** | Compare the original and translated text sentence by sentence to accurately grasp even the subtlest nuances of technical terms. |
| **🏗️ Flawless PDF Structure Analysis** | Accurately parses complex layouts, including multi-column text, tables, and images, preserving the original structure as much as possible using the `docling` library. |
| **📄 Flexible Triple-Format Output** | Generates the original text (`_en.md`), the translated text (`_ko.md`), and a combined version (`_combined.md`) for versatile use. |
| **🏷️ Quick Reference to Original** | Displays the original PDF page number `(p. N)` next to every text block, allowing for quick reference back to the source. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Usage

For example, to translate the sample file included in the project (the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper) with default settings (English->Korean), run the following command:

```bash
python main.py "samples/1706.03762v7.pdf"
```

**Specifying Languages (Optional):**

You can specify the source language with the `-f` (`--from`) option and the target language with the `-t` (`--to`) option.

```bash
# Translate an English PDF to German
python main.py "samples/1706.03762v7.pdf" -f en -t de
```

### 🎨 Output Example

The translated output (`_combined.md`) is generated with original and translated sentences side-by-side, making it very convenient to read and compare.
